## Notes

* Chart namings are based on the day in the United States, for example a chart labeled "2025-05-12" took place on 12 May 2025, exchange time. In New Zealand, this journal entry will be recorded for 13 May 2025.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily developed through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), with occasional edits in IntelliJ WebStorm for mass find-and-replace and non-markdown file management.
You will need the [templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin to generate snippets of each journal entry so the template variables are filled.
