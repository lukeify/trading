## "Trading Psychology: How to handle FOMO"

Three good ways to deal with FOMO:

### Exposure therapy

Associate a peaceful/pleasant scenario with your fears, starting from least fearful to most fearful.
### Cognitive behavioural therapy

Create an ABCD/cognitive journal which helps you identify fears, your feelings about them, and the consequences of them. This is a four column journal detailing:

- "A" defines the *activating event*, which defines the event which got you upset.
- "B" reflects your *beliefs* about the event, this is your self-talk, explain WHY you think it's upsetting.
- "C" are the *consequences*. How does it make you feel? What impact does it have on you?
- "D" for the *disputation* of the negative thinking—how would you talk about this issue with someone else you care about? Positively and constructively. Talk to yourself the way you would talk to others.

Create a learning P&L. I have already partially integrated this into my trading plan as I ask myself what are the positive and negative things that occur each trading day, and how I can improve these in the future.

### Broaden & build

You want a diversified life portfolio. If your trading goes wrong, you want another thing to see the positives in life that provides overall perspective.

### Conclusion

All of these techniques require consistency.

Instead of getting frustrated at a losing trade, it is information that I can use to further optimise and make better decisions next time—it is extremely important to document failed trades especially.

Set a few high priority goals, not an unsustainable amount of goals.
