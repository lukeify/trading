# Patterns & Strategies

## ABCD Pattern

A pattern involving identifying four points on a chart. The legs between the four points represent different movements in the price action:
- Leg AB = The start of the pattern, the price moves upwards on an initial trend, often a catalyst such as news or start of trading. Point B marks a high where the pullback begins. This will have high volume.
- Leg BC = Retracement of the initial move from Point B, often in a Fibonacci-pattern where the retracement ends—Point C—above Point A. This will have lower volume than the previous leg.
- Leg CD = A continuation of the original trend, aiming to break past support or resistance. This is often where you buy in.

After point D, if successful will usually have very high volume.

The second bullish line never breaks though the first and the second bearish line never breaks through the first. Consider fibonacci retracement.

Aziz will buy in between points C and D, at a price between B & C, with a stop loss being the low of point C. Take profit should be the minimum of A.

Consider if VWAP is acting as a support.

## Bull Flag Momentum

A pattern involving one or more large jumps in stock price, followed by a consolidation period (the flag). Buy in during the consolidation period. Can happen on many different chart periods, 1 minute, 2 minute, 5 minute, etc

Never buy during the flag pole, always buy during the consolidation period, awaiting another pole. The stop loss should be the support of the previous consolidation. Never trade more than 2 bull flags in a single stock, will usually sell off after that.

On low float stocks, Aziz will only jump in after confirmation of a breakout. This reduces risk and exposure time in low float stocks.

Flag poles will usually have high volume. Exit on completion of the flag pole.

Beginners should be careful trading this. Risky strategy that requires a fast execution platform.

## Top & Bottom Reversals

Identified by multiple consecutive candles in a single direction on the 5 minute chart, followed by an indecision candle.
Features to identify with:

- Stock has an extreme 5 minute RSI value above 90 or below 10.
- Only buy after the reversal is confirmed. It’s possible an indecision candle does not necessarily lead to a reversal.
- Is being traded at an important intraday support or resistance level.
    - Only take bottom reversals when the stock is near a support level.
    - Only take top reversals when the stock is near a resistance level.
- When the trend reaches its end, indecision candles will form.

Need to wait for confirmation or reversal before entering, not just the indecision candle. This could be first candle to reach a new high at an important intraday support. Can also confirm with higher than normal volume.

It must be near a support or resistance level! RSI must be very high or low.

Take profit when the stocks reaches an intraday level or a moving average.

## Moving Average Trend

When a trend emerges around a stock in play, usually around the 9 EMA on the 1 or 5 minute candles, consider following the trend. Entry should be close to the EMA line to minimise stop loss. Stop should usually be slightly below the EMA line, or if using candlesticks, when it closes through the line.

Before implementing this strategy, check previous days trading data to see if stock respects moving averages.

False breakouts above/below an EMA can happen when there is low volume—experienced traders wait until a 5 minute candle closes breaking the EMA.

Aziz rarely uses these because they are slow and can leave you exposed to the market for a long time, and can be hard to identify moving average trends just after open

## VWAP Trading

The relation between VWAP and price can show who is in overall control of a stock. If a price is above VWAP, buyers are in control, if a price is below VWAP, sellers are in control.

Institutional traders often try and buy or sell close to VWAP as it’s used as a measurement for efficiency by institutions—if an institutional trader buys well above VWAP they may be penalised for this (and vice versa for selling). Retail traders can take advantage of this.

After open as volatility decreases, a stock may move toward or away from VWAP. This can be used as a test to see if an institutional trader will buy/sell. If they place a buy, the stock may pop over VWAP and move higher, and day traders could ride along. If there is no interest from market makers or institutions, the price may trade sideways near VWAP, in which case retail traders should ignore this.

Half-dollars and full dollars often act as support/resistance.

When daytrading around VWAP, entry should be as close as possible to VWAP, and stop loss should be a candle closing below VWAP. Trade should be kept until profit target or new support/resistance level is reached.

## Support & Resistance

If support & resistance lines are difficult or impossible to find, they don’t have to be drawn. Instead, consider trading on VWAP or moving averages.

Aziz doesn’t like diagonal trend Ines.
