# _How to Day Trade for a Living_ 
by Andrew Aziz

## General Notes

- Minimum risk to reward is 2:1, and stop loss and take profit should be based on technical analysis, not arbitrary positions on the chart.
- Never risk more than 2% of your account size on a single trade.
- Consider hiding the unrealised P&L values when in a trade to focus on executing the trade perfectly rather than on dollar values.
- Day trading is about managing risk, not buying and selling stocks.
- You are only as good as the stocks you trade.

## Tools

Aziz does not recommend IBKR Workstation—but does not state why. Likely because it is not direct access software like DAS Trader Pro, which is his personal preference.

## "Stocks in play"

- Look for stocks that have high relative volume, have recent news, had large changes in premarket, or develops important intraday levels for trading.
- Must have high average liquidity—author only trades stocks with more than 500,000 shares per day.
- Stay away from stocks that are trading normally.
- Stocks in play will often be in play for several days after.
- Must have fundamental catalysts that cause the stock to move.

### Classes of Stock

#### Low float stocks under $10

Not recommended for new retail traders

Optimal strategies:

- Bull Flag Momentum

#### Medium float stocks ($10–100)

Optimal strategies:

- VWAP 
- Support/Resistance

#### Megacap stocks

Impossible for retail traders to shift.

Optimal strategies:

- Moving Average
- Reversal

### Pre-market scanner

Aziz defines a pre-market scanner on page 87:

- Gapped up or down in premarket +- 2%
- Pre-market shares traded >50,000
- Average daily volume >500,000
- Average True Range > 50c
- Short interest no higher than 30%
- Must have some fundamental catalyst (news, earnings, etc)

### Real-time volume scanner

Aziz defines a real-time volume scanner on page 88:

- Gapped up or down at least $1
- Average True Range >50c
- Average relative volume 1.5x
- Average daily volume >500,000

### Reversal scanner

Also defines a reversal scanner:

### Miscellaneous notes

Can also run real-time intraday scans to scan for stocks which have strategies that are not applicable to market open conditions, such as top and bottom reversal strategies

Need to consider the sector of the stock in play. If lots of stocks in play are in the same sector, the sector may be under institutional control.

Never use market orders, always use marketable limit orders, which prioritise immediacy, but ensure a cap is present so that you don’t overpay when buying. For example, a stock trading at a bid-ask of $99.95–$100.00 could have a marketable limit order of $100.00+5 cents, to buy up to $100.05. This caps slippage.

Short Selling Restrictions mean that short sellers buying back in must pay the ask, not the bid.

### Trading communities

Aziz mentions the following trading communities:

1. Dan Kaufman’s Theotrade (theotrade.com)
2. John Carter’s Simplertrading (simplertrading.com)
3. Investors Underground
4. Warrior Trading (Ross Cameron)
5. Elite Trader
6. Trade 2 Win

## Price Action
**Spinning top candles** have large wicks relative to the body and indicate market indecision, and can be useful in identifying reversal.

**Doji candles** (shooting star, hammer) have very small bodies and often an asymmetrical wick, the former indicating that bulls tried to push the price higher and failed, the latter indicating bears tried to push the price lower and failed.

Indecision candles alone are not enough though—must combine it with

## Trading Strategy

> Novice traders believe that when they enter the trade, they should not do anything else but patiently wait for the price to hit their profit target or stop loss level. This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know that this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea. As the market moves after your entry, you will receive new price action and data about your initial trade idea. The price action of the stock will either be supporting or not supporting your reasons for being in that trade. Therefore, you need to manage your open position.

The likelihood of how confident you are a trade will go in your favour should determine your initial sizing. 
Consider scaling into trades as the price action works into your favour. 
Never scale down into a losing trade. 
Not recommended for beginners.

Don’t “chase stocks,” i.e. buy when the price is rising. 
Professionals will buy during quiet periods and sell during volatile ones.

Stocks sell off for two reasons:

1. Institutional traders and hedge funds have started selling their large positions.
2. Traders have started short selling on bad news, but will have to cover shorts later by buying back. 

The latter is a good opportunity to wait for an entry, as the stock may reverse quickly: a “short squeeze”, which can be ridden.

Master a single strategy first with your identified trading plan. Don’t try and trade everything.

### Time of day
Aziz states new traders do better during late-morning, and worst at open.

#### Open

#### Late-morning

#### Midday

Lowest volatility and volume.

#### Close

Market professionals dominate trading here, do not bet against them.
