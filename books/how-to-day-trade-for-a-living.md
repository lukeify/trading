# _How to Day Trade for a Living_

by Andrew Aziz

## General Notes

- The minimum risk to reward for any trade is 2:1. Your stop loss and take profit should be based on technical analysis, not arbitrary positions on the chart.
- Never risk more than 2% of your account size on a single trade.
- Consider hiding the unrealised P&L values when in a trade to focus on executing the trade perfectly rather than focusing on dollar values.
- Day trading is about managing risk, not buying and selling stocks.
- You are only as good as the stocks you trade.
- You must become process-oriented, not result-oriented.
- Every day is a new game and a new puzzle to solve.
- Momentum trades are the hardest to execute and manage risk in.
- Aziz strongly believes that you should focus on only one strategy at a time.
- You must give yourself 6–8 months to become consistently profitable.
- It does not matter how unprofitable you are during your first 6–8 months, and your first months are ultimately unimportant.

## Chapter 4: How to Find Stocks for Trades

The fundamental concept is to find "_stocks in play_"—these are stocks with high relative volume, moving on a catalyst, that are likely to be traded by other retail investors. This gives day traders the best shot at capitalising on human-generated price action, rather than succumbing to high frequency and algorithmic trading from institutions designed to take your money.

### "Stocks in play"

- Look for stocks that have high relative volume, have recent news, had large changes in premarket price, or develop important intraday levels for trading.
- Must have high average liquidity—Aziz only trades stocks with an average volume of more than 500,000 shares per day.
- Stay away from stocks that are trading normally.
- Stocks in play will often be in play for several days after the fact.
- Stocks must have a fundamental catalyst that causes the stock to move. This could be earnings, political news, a media event, a product release, a drug trial, etc.

### Classes of Stock

Aziz's definition of _medium float_ is "20–500 million" according to the glossary of the book, [but also hosts a PDF on Bear Bull Traders](https://bearbulltraders.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/AndrewAziz-How_to_Day_Trade_for_a_Living_AUDIOBOOK-FIGS.pdf) where he describes _medium float_ as being "10–500 million". It can therefore be assumed that _low float_ refers to stocks under 10 or 20 million shares.

#### Low float stocks under $10

Only recommended for very experienced or highly equipped retail traders as low liquidity can cause high and unexpected volatility. Optimal strategy is [Bull Flag Momentum](../patterns.md#Bull%20Flag%20Momentum).

#### Medium float stocks ($10–100)

Many of the strategies Aziz describes works well on these, especially [VWAP](../patterns.md#VWAP) and [Support & Resistance](../patterns.md#Support%20&%20Resistance). Medium float stocks priced greater than $100 are not popular amongst retail traders.

#### Mega-cap stocks

Impossible for retail traders to shift as the price action is controlled by institutions. Retail traders should avoid them unless there is a good fundamental catalyst present. [Top & Bottom Reversal](../patterns.md#Top%20&%20Bottom%20Reversal) and [Moving Average](../patterns.md#Moving%20Average) strategies work the best on these.

### Pre-market scanner

Aziz defines a pre-market scanner on page 87:

- Gapped up or down in premarket ±2%
- Pre-market shares traded > 50,000
- Average daily volume > 500,000
- Average True Range > 50c
- Short interest no higher than 30%
- Must have some fundamental catalyst (news, earnings, etc)

### Real-time volume scanner

Aziz defines a real-time volume scanner on page 88:

- Gapped up or down at least $1
- Average True Range > 50c
- Average relative volume 1.5x
- Average daily volume > 500,000

### Real-time reversal scanner

Aziz also mentions an intra-day reversal scanner that he later details in the "Strategies" section around trading reversal patterns. Intra-day scanners are useful for identifying trades on stocks that are not applicable in market open conditions. For example, five consecutive green or red candles could be the basis for a real-time reversal scanner.

### Miscellaneous notes

You should consider the sector of the stock in play. If many of stocks in play are in the same sector, the sector may be under institutional control.

Never use market orders, always use _marketable limit orders_, which prioritise immediacy, but ensure a cap is present so that you don’t overpay when buying. For example, a stock trading at a bid-ask of $99.95–$100.00 could have a marketable limit order of $100.00+5 cents, to buy up to $100.05. This caps slippage up to your limit.

A _Short Selling Restriction_ means that short sellers buying back in must pay the ask, not the bid.

### Trading communities

Aziz mentions the following trading communities:

1. Dan Kaufman’s Theotrade (theotrade.com)
2. John Carter’s Simplertrading (simplertrading.com)
3. Investors Underground
4. Warrior Trading (Ross Cameron)
5. Elite Trader
6. Trade 2 Win
7. trade-ideas.com
## Chapter 5: Tools & Platforms

Aziz does not recommend IBKR Workstation—but does not state why. This is likely because it is not direct access software like DAS Trader Pro, which is his personal preference.

### Aziz's hotkeys for charts buying long

| Action                       | Shortcut |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| 1 Minute Chart               | F1       |
| 5 Minute Chart               | F2       |
| Daily Chart                  | F4       |
| Weekly Chart                 | F5       |
| Monthly Chart                | F6       |
| Buy 400 @ LIMIT ask + 0.05   | Alt + 1  |
| Buy 200 @ LIMIT ask + 0.05   | Alt + Q  |
| Buy 100 @ LIMIT ask + 0.05   | Alt + A  |
| Sell ½ @ LIMIT buy − 0.05    | Alt + 2  |
| Sell full @ LIMIT buy − 0.05 | Alt + 3  |

## Price Action

**Spinning top candles** have large wicks relative to the body and indicate market indecision, and can be useful in identifying a reversal.

**Doji candles** (shooting star, hammer) have very small bodies and often an asymmetrical wick, the former indicating that bulls tried to push the price higher and failed, the latter indicating bears tried to push the price lower and failed.

Indecision candles alone though are not enough for the basis of a trade—you must look for confirmation candles, as well as other forms of analysis such as support or resistance levels, to provide a suitable trade entry.

## Chapter 7: Important Day Trading Strategies

> _Novice traders believe that when they enter the trade, they should not do anything else but patiently wait for the price to hit their profit target or stop loss level. This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know that this is not sufficient._
>
> _When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea. As the market moves after your entry, you will receive new price action and data about your initial trade idea. The price action of the stock will either be supporting or not supporting your reasons for being in that trade._
>
> _Therefore, you need to manage your open position._

The likelihood of how confident you are a trade will go in your favour should determine your initial sizing. Consider scaling into trades as the price action works into your favour, but never scale down into a losing trade.

Don’t “chase stocks”, i.e. buy when the price is rising. Professionals will buy during quiet periods and sell during volatile ones.

Stocks sell off for two reasons:

1. Institutional traders and hedge funds have started selling their large positions.
2. Traders have started short selling on bad news, but will have to cover shorts later by buying back.

The latter is a good opportunity to wait for an entry, as the stock may reverse quickly: a “short squeeze”, which can be ridden.

Master a single strategy first with your identified trading plan. Don’t try and trade everything. Trading strategies should be written down, and ideally backtested on historical data to verify that it is worth trading

### Time of day

Aziz has a rule to not lose more than 30% of what he made during open. If he does, he will stop trading.

#### Open

Lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, and Aziz will trade with the most size and frequency during the open, which is his statistically most profitable period. He will trade *ORBs*, *bull flag momentum*, and *VWAP* strategies during open.

#### Late-morning

Easiest time of day for new traders. There is less volume in late-morning, but also less unexpected volatility.

#### Midday

Market is slowest during midday (12PM to 3PM), and often this is the most dangerous time of day with lower volume and liquidity. Aziz often does the worst during midday. Some of the best strategies for midday include *reversal*, *VWAP*, *moving average*, and *support and resistance*.

#### Close

Market professionals dominate trading here, do not bet against them. Any directional moves you make should be aligned with their opinion, not against it.

## Chapter 8: Step by Step to a Successful Trade

Having a simple trading method with only a few minimal setups is all you need to become a profitable day trader. Aziz’s process:

### Create a morning routine

Consider going for a run before trading as increasing aerobic exercise has been correlated with better cognitive performance.

### Develop a watchlist

Watch each watchlisted stock in the 15 minutes prior to market open. Create potential plans and strategies for each stock:

- What is my plan if it sets up to the long side?
- What about the short side?
- Where will my stop loss be?
- Is the profit window large enough for the trade to make sense?
- How might support and resistance levels affect the trading?

### Organise a trade plan

By the time 9:30AM arrives, you should have your trading plan in place and how you intend to initiate trades on the stocks on your watchlist based on the if-then scenarios you have developed in pre-market.

### Initiate trades according to your plan

Before entering a trade, identify what pattern you are trading. If you cannot give it a name, you should not enter the trade. Once a setup arrives, Aziz will then enter such trades without question.

### Execute trades according to your plan

A bad entry will make a mess of your plan and you will eventually lose your money.

Without a plan, it can be difficult to not exit trades early. If you plan ahead of time, you will have a much better chance letting winning trades work and cutting losses off quickly.

### Journal and reflect

Ask yourself:

- What did I do right?
- What did I do wrong?
- Should I have sold earlier?

## Chapter 9: Case Study of a Newly Successful Trader

John’s advice that turned around his trading career was:

- Risk the same amount of money per trade.
- Risk a small amount of money per trade until consistency.
- Use hard stops to exit trades.
- Focus on a single strategy until you master it.

Start thinking in terms of R: the monetary quantity of risk per trade, and assign all trades the same risk.

John had success with a BHOD (Break High of Day) strategy that involved scalping beyond the high of day, taking 50% partials, and then enjoying a risk free trade after moving his stop to break even.

## Chapter 10: Next Steps for Beginner Traders

Three important skills underlie all successful day trading:

> *1. Constantly analyse the balance of power between buyers and sellers and bet on the winning group.*
>
> *2. You need to practice excellent money and trade management.*
>
> *3. And you need sufficient self-discipline to follow your trading plan, to avoid getting overexcited or depressed in the markets, and to resist the temptation to make emotional decisions*

###  The Seven Essentials for Day Trading

1. Education and simulated trading
2. Preparation
3. Determination and hard work
4. Patience
5. Discipline
6. Mentorship and a community of traders
7. Reflection and review

One of the most important aspects of trading in a simulator is to develop the mental model for if-then statements and process that information quickly.
### Reflection & Review

Questions to always ask yourself:

- Who is in control of the price? Buyers or sellers?
- What technical levels are most important?
- Is this stock stronger or weaker than the market?
- Where is most of the volume being traded? At VWAP? In the first 5 minutes? Near moving averages?
- How much volume at a price causes the stock to move up or down? (You can look at Level 2 for this)
- What is the bid-ask spread? Is it tradeable?
- How quickly is the stock moving? Is it being traded smoothly, or is it choppy?
- Is the stock trading in a particular pattern on a 5 minute chart? What about the 1 minute chart?

It can often be better to switch to trading in a simulator after some losses rather than turning your computer off.

You must open positions at a price that offers excellent risk:reward, and not one that has moved away from a good entry. That is called _chasing the stock_.

In your trading journal, add the following points for each trade:

- Your physical wellbeing (have you had enough sleep? Are you too hungry?)
- The time of day of the trade
- The anticipated strategy, entry, and size.
- How you found the opportunity (chatroom, scanner, etc)
- Quality of your entry from a risk:reward perspective
- Sizing/management of your trade (scaling in, scaling out)
- Exit execution (following or profit targets or stop losses)

Modify your trading journal to also include prompts on why it was a bad trade:

- Was it stock selection?
- Entry point?
- Discipline or psychology?

Aziz live-records all of his trades during the morning session and rewatches them to note important observations on entry, exit, price action, level 2 signals, etc. Additionally, he will:

- Look for new algorithmic programs to be aware of.
- Search for areas in trades where he could have added more size.
- Identify times he could have hold for longer in winning trades.
- Find spots where he was too aggressive.
- Identify when he took a trade that offered a poor risk:reward opportunity.
- Reviews his position sizing, where he took profits, where he added more.

###  Plan your trading business

Build a **business plan** consisting of three components:

- The trading framework
- Activities designed to improve the trading framework
- Tasks outside of trading

#### The trading framework

This is the core of your business plan, and is separate from your daily trading plan that you develop each day, which consists of the stocks you've picked, your rationale, your trading if-then scenarios, and your review.

It consists of:

- Your money and risk management principles.
    - What your "numbers" are to apply the correct risk:reward in order to achieve an acceptable return, such as:
    - What percentage of your account to risk per trade (or a maximum dollar value you will risk per trade).
    - When you will scale up.
    - How much money you are aiming to make each day.
    - The maximum amount of money you are prepared to lose each day.
    - The maximum number of trades you will take in a day.
- The strategies and patterns you trade.
- Your trade management rules. Consider questions such as:
    - When should a first partial be taken? What size should that be?
    - Should I move stop loss to breakeven after taking a partial?
- How you will be accountable for actions when you deviate from your framework.
    - Do you stop trading? Do you trade in a simulator?

#### Activities designed to improve the trading framework

Create an **education plan** of what you need to accomplish over a long period of time, to give you an estimate of how long that may take to meet your trading goals, and to manage your expectations.

Setting **goals** that are SMART (Specific, Measurable, attainable, Relevant, Time-based) for daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual goals; and capture progress on them to ensure you maintain a positive emotional attitude on your journey.

Creating and modifying **trading rules** based on your learnings, journalling, and analysis to improve the quality of your trading.

Design a **mission statement** to capture the essence of you trading goals and the philosophies that support them. It also signals what your business is all about to yourself.

These questions will help you design your business plan:

- Who is going to be your support network?
- What are your long-term goals?
- When are you available to trade?
- Who are you going to learn from?
- Why do you want to day trade?
- What capital is available to you?

#### Tasks outside of trading

This encompasses all items that take up time, but do not directly involve trading or the performance of your trading framework. It includes:

An **action plan** to explain how you will manage your trading business. Setting up your trading station, finding communities and resources to use, developing a daily routine, finding an accountant, etc.

Your **vision**. This is your dream, written with long-term perspective in mind—in a short sentence or two, why do you want to day trade, and what do you hope to accomplish?

A **trading business timeline** that tracks from your decision to start trading, through your education and use of a simulator, to live trading in a real account. Use benchmarks to ensure your progress is improving, and how much you've accomplished.

The **tools and services** you will use. Including your broker, trading platform, any other software you pay for, any communities you are a part of.

### Journaling your trades

Consider using an automated platform such as _Tradervue_ or _Chartlog_ to journal your trades.

## Andrew's 10 Rules of Day Trading

1. Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly.
2. Day trading is not easy. It is a serious business, and you should treat it as such.
3. Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If necessary, you must sell with a loss to make sure you do not hold onto any stock overnight.
4. Always ask, "Is this stock moving because the overall market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique fundamental catalyst?"
5. Success in day trading comes from risk management—finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.
6. Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. You cannot be a successful day trader without excellent risk management skills, even if you are the master of many effective strategies.
7. Retail traders trade only *Stocks in Play*, high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.
8. Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.
9. Green candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Red candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.
10. Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.
