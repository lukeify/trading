# Business Plan

My trading business plan is broken down into the following pages:

- The [trading framework](trading-framework) that describes what strategies I follow, what my metrics are, what rules I define for account and risk management, and how I manage trades. These are the core business rules that are implemented day to day. 
  
  The strategies implemented are described in detail with a page each:
	- A 15-minute [opening range breakout](strategies/opening-range-breakout) strategy.
	- A [VWAP breakout](strategies/vwap-breakout) strategy.
	  
- An [improvement plan](improvement-plan) whose goal is to result in improvements to the trading framework. This includes reviewing performance on weekly and monthly timeframes, identifying areas of improvement, and goals setting.
  
- A section on [supporting tasks](supporting.md) unrelated to the core duties of the trading framework and the improvement plan, but that enable it to function properly. This covers accounting, expenses, tools and services used, as well as hotkey and colour specifications.
