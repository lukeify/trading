# My Trading Setup

## Broker

IBKR Pro, opened initially with a cash daytrading account to avoid PDT rules.
Will self-fund over time.

## Scanners

Currently using ZenBot.

### Todos

- Read ZenBot user documentation.
- Learn and use TradingView scanner.
- Review Ross Cameron & Andrew Aziz‚Äôs criteria for identifying stocks in play.
- Need to find a real-time scanner that can alert to bull flag momentum on low float stocks.
- Need to find a top and bottom reversal scanner.
- Investigate WeBull scanner.
- Investigate IBKR scanner.

## Trading & Charting Platforms

TradingView to browse charts and place orders initially. May re-evaluate this as TradingView has poor support for hotkeys and there are some concerns about how real-time the data is, even on paid subscriptions.
