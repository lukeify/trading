## Tools, Services, & Platforms

Currently considering:

* MotiveWave Pro
	* US$99/month, or one-time payment of US$1495 for 1 year of updates and support, with a additional 1 year of updates and support for US$225 thereafter.
* Sierra Charts
	* Service Package 11
* DAS Trader Pro

If the latter two, will likely use TradingView Premium (US$323.88/year) with TradingView Market Data (US$9.95/month) for charting.

## Subscription Data

I am currently subscribed to market depth data through IBKR, as this seems to be the most cost effective platform for real-time data.

### Level 1 Data

Level 1 data provides best bid/ask, aka "top of book" real-time streaming quotes.
