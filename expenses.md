## Tools, Services, & Platforms

Medium term plan is to use the following tools while I establish proof of profitability.

- DAS Trader Pro (Deluxe Plan, $150/month), with OTC/Options swapped for ARCA Book.
- TradingView Premium
	- Including U.S. Stock Markets bundle

Once profitability has been established and a track record built for several months, will likely switch to Lightspeed Trader, whilst still maintaining a TradingView premium subscription for charts.

- Lightspeed Trader (Reg-T Margin Account)
- TradingView Premium
	- Including U.S. Stock Markets bundle

### MotiveWave

Subscribed to the _Pro_ version for one month to test its functionality. While the software itself works well, the connection to the IBKR TWS API is inconsistent.

## Market Data

I currently receive market data through my DAS Trader Pro subscription as well as TradingView's market data bundle.

### IBKR

Discontinued as the Level 2 data is "pulsed", and provided by my trading platform (DAS Trader Pro).

#### Level 1 Data

Level 1 data provides best bid/ask, aka "top of book" real-time streaming quotes.

#### Level 2 Data

Level 2 data provides real-time streaming market depth, i.e. the "order book", beyond the best bid and ask.

### dxfeed

I used dxfeed to integrate historical tick data with MotiveWave, however since I am no longer using MotiveWave itself this became redundant.
