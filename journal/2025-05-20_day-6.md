## Trades

### RGTI Long (#1)

### NVAX Long (#2)

## What went right?

- My initial TWS configuration seems to work reasonably well with no major blockers.
- Two more winning trades.
- Partial selling continues to be an emotionally enjoyable risk buydown strategy. 

## What went wrong?

- Sell hotkey didn't bind correctly in TWS.

## What improvements can I make?

- [ ] As per the BearBullTraders premarket show, I should consider documenting the positions I am not trading. A trading journal only documents decisions I do made.
- [ ] Fix my IBKR TWS so that my _sell_ hotkey works correctly.
- [ ] Start thinking about introducing a realtime scanner source alongside using ZenBot & BearBullTraders as a premarket volume scanner to identify more opportunities. 

## What did I learn?

- Paper accounts in IBKR Pro don't inherit the pricing structure of your main account. For example, if your main account uses the (often superior) [tiered pricing model](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/pricing/commissions-stocks.php), your paper account will still default to the fixed pricing model which charges a minimum of US$1.00 per order.
  This serves to artificially deflate your commission P&L percentage, as your commission normally on a tiered account order begins at US$0.35.
