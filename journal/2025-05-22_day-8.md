## What went right?

- Right

## What went wrong?

- Because I had my TradingView charts set to show ETH during the morning, the VWAP Session indicator took into account premarket volume in its calculation. This is less respected than VWAP that only accounts for regular market hours, and caused me to miss a rejection off VWAP for QBTS.
- The volume shown in TradingView is materially different when only the Cboe One network is considered. 
- I arguably over traded. In particular, my fourth trade was based on _hoping_ that there would be a breakout above the $17.00 price point, rather than waiting for confirmation.

## What improvements can I make?

- [ ] Improvement
- [ ] When I buy TradingView, I should also buy U.S. market data.
- [ ] I should build a macOS hotkey application.

## What did I learn?

- Session VWAP that includes premarket/extended hours is not as well respected only includes regular trading.
