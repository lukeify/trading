## What went right?

* Correctly identified a trade that would’ve gone my way if I’d taken it, with good SL.

## What went wrong?

* Wasn’t able to execute any trades due to the learnings below.

## What improvements can I make?

- [x] Buy L2 data.
- [x] Watch videos on how L2 data within TradingView works.
- [x] Watch video on how the long/short position tool works.

## What did I learn?

* Lots of limitations with IBKR accounts:
	* Paper accounts that are margin are subject to the PDT rule.
	* Live cash accounts are subject to cash settlement rules that mean it can take 1–2 days for money used in trades to be used again.
* Didn’t know that TradingView will display CBOE-only data for IBKR paper accounts, but live streaming data for IBKR live accounts.
    * Switching to Live Account and then back to Paper account helped.
