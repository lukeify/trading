## What went right?

1. The Discord groups I am in appear to be useful.
2. Even though I was using market orders with no stop loss, I manually stopped out and sold when the trade exited my planned thesis, demonstrating good risk management.
3. I was careful not to overtrade.

## What went wrong?

1. Order confirmation screen setting on TradingView tripped me up and made entries slower.
    1. Confirms hotkeys are a must for any fast trades.
2. Usage of market orders made my entries sub-optimal.
3. All five trades had poor entry, little to no volume confirmation, and were not profitable.

## What improvements can I make?

- [ ] Despite watching a video on the Long & Short position tools, I find the sizing and entry ergonomics counter-intuitive. Force myself to use it, or switch to a better tool.
- [ ] Learn the difference between Limit and Marketable Limit orders.
- [ ] Find a way within TradingView to set marketable limit orders instead of using market buys and sells.
- [ ] Find video courses I can watch.
- [ ] Re-read sections on patterns in book and consolidate notes.
- [ ] Find out how Andrew Aziz enters trades with hotkeys.
- [ ] Find out how Trader Workstation might handle hotkeys.

## What did I learn?

* Consider the correlation with SPX when both selecting tickets and entering trades. Trading against market flow is probably suboptimal.
